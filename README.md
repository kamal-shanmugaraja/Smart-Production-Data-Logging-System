# Smart Production Data Logging System for Industrial Looms
## Project Overview
The system is designed to monitor critical operational data from industrial textile manufacturing looms in real time. It captures eight distinct parameters, providing valuable insights for production optimization, predictive maintenance, and quality control. The firmware is engineered for high precision and reliability in a demanding industrial environment.   

## Key Features
* Real-time Monitoring: Simultaneously monitors and logs 8 different parameters from industrial looms.

* High-Precision RPM Calculation: Implements an interrupt-driven system for precise calculation and integration of the loom's revolutions per minute (RPM), a critical performance metric.   

* Production-Grade Firmware: Developed with a focus on robustness, stability, and efficiency for deployment in a 24/7 manufacturing setting.

* ESP32 Platform
